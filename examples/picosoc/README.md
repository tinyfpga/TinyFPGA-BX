# Video Notes

Git repository https://github.com/mattvenn/TinyFPGA-BX/tree/master/examples/picosoc

The README.md contains information on:

* Information about installing the toolchains
* Electrical wiring for the demos 
* Precompiled firmware binaries:
	* master - starting point
	* ws2812 - includes ws2812 driver and serial driver

# PicoSOC TinyFPGA example

PicoSOC is an SOC - system on chip. It includes everything you need to 
run a RiscV CPU on the TinyFPGA.

The RiscV CPU is PicoRV32, made by Clifford Wolf. The original repo is here:

https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32

The SOC example that uses the PicoRV32 was originally made for the Lattice 8k evaluation
board. This example has been modified to work with the TinyFPGA by Luke from TinyFPGA.

# FPGA Toolchain

You can synthesise the demo with the [icestorm](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/) toolchain.
A very convient way to install the toolchain is to use [APIO](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio)
And then set your path to include the installed tools and copy the chipdb and yosys files:

	export PATH=$PATH:~/.apio/packages/toolchain-icestorm/bin/
	sudo cp -r ~/.apio/packages/toolchain-icestorm/share/icebox/ /usr/local/share/
	sudo cp -r ~/.apio/packages/toolchain-icestorm/share/yosys /usr/local/share/


You will also need tinyprog:

	pip install tinyprog

For more info on the TinyFPGA tools and setup see the TinyFPGA page: https://tinyfpga.com/bx/guide.html

At this point you should be able to run make upload to synthesise the hardware and program to the TinyFPGA.
I have precompiled the firmware.c and added the firmware.bin and hex files to the repo so you don't need GCC.

If you just want to see the demos in the video, you can switch to the ws2812 branch

	git checkout ws2812

Which should allow you to program the precompiled firmware or run the simulation without installing GCC.

# GCC for firmware compilation

As this is a RiscV CPU running on the FPGA, we really need the RiscV GCC tools to get the most out of it!
Fetching the repos and compiling took about 3 hours on my 4 year old T400 Lenovo laptop. Full instructions
here: https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32#building-a-pure-rv32i-toolchain

What I did was:

	sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl libmpc-dev \
		libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo \
		gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev git libexpat1-dev

	git clone git@github.com:cliffordwolf/picorv32.git
	cd picorv32/
	time make -j2 build-riscv32i-tools
	export PATH=$PATH:/opt/riscv32i/bin/

Then make firmware.bin should work and you can then write your own c program or edit my demos.

# Wiring for the demo

* Serial TX is pin 1
* Serial RX is pin 2
* WS2812 data is pin 3
